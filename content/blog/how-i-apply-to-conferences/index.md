title: "How I Apply to Conferences"
---

As of November 2022, I've applied to about 100 unique conferences and gotten accepted to about a third of them.
I've also started helping out organizing conferences, such as reviewing talks submitted by speakers.
So while I'm not the greatest conference speaker in the world, I think I've gotten at least good at them.

This blog post goes over the process that I take to submit my talks to CFPs (Call For Proposals).
That process can be summarized in the following steps:

1. [Pre-Work](#1-pre-work)
1. [Research the conference](#2-research-the-conference)
1. [Determine topic matches](#3-determine-topic-matches)
1. [Sketch the story](#4-sketch-the-story)
1. [Submit the CFP](#5-submit-the-cfp)
1. [Don't get my hopes up](#6-dont-get-my-hopes-up)

I've added a bunch of [FAQs](#faqs) to the end, too.
Let me know if you have any other questions to add!

## 1. Pre-Work

Speaking at a conference is rarely the first bit of community involvement speakers take.
Start with smaller events so you can build your skills and network with other people in your areas of programming.

The strategy I took was:

1.  Start attending meetups, such as city-specific ones
1.  Speak at a meetup
1.  Actively ask meetup organizers for feedback on your talks there
1.  Repeat the previous two steps a few times
1.  Start attending conferences

Attending meetups and conferences is helpful for seeing what does or doesn't work in talks.
What kinds of topics do you relate to as an attendee?
What speaking styles, narrative arcs, and general storytelling methods make you excited about the topic and/or effectively transmit information to you?
Keep track of these things and remember them for when you want to submit your talks.

## 2. Research the conference

So you've found a conference you want to speak at.
Great!
Familiarize yourself with what the conference is about and what kinds of talks they tend to include:

-   Thoroughly read their website
-   Follow the conference and any organizers you can find on any social media you use
-   Watch talks from the most recent 1-2 iterations of the event

You wouldn't believe how many talk submissions CFPs get that are clearly low quality copy & paste, only barely suitable -if at all- for the conference's intended subject matter. 🙃

## 3. Determine Topic Matches

Now that you have a feel for what the conference is looking for, try to recall your areas of work that match.
You don't need to present some amazing cutting-edge novel idea: just information you think attendees might want to know about.

A few examples of topic match areas I've seen come up frequently are:

-   General software engineering:
    -   Coding patterns you've found useful
    -   Documentation and/or new developer onboarding strategies
    -   How you approach testing
    -   Getting started using a popular framework
-   Frontend:
    -   Best practices with your chosen UI library (Angular components, React hooks, ...)
    -   Design systems
    -   How your team does microfrontends
    -   Using TypeScript
-   React:
    -   CSS-in-JS libraries (Emotion, Tailwind, Vanilla Extract, ...)
    -   Integrations with other libraries (Apollo, Redux, tRPC, ...)
    -   Your latest 🌶 hot take on hooks

It's impossible to know what topics will match well with organizers.
Since most conferences allow multiple CFP submissions, I generally try with a few different topics, often 2-3 out of:

1. A talk directly on the conference's focus
1. A talk generally on the conference's focus, but with a twist and/or another area
1. A talk partially on the conference's focus, but more on another topic and/or a fun twist

### Aside: Naming Talks

I find naming talks to be one of the hardest parts of CFPs.
A good talk title needs to be clear, concise, and to the point.
It's also often beneficial to include some flashy tech buzzwords to draw people in.

For inspiration, see other talks submitted to that same conference.

## 4. Sketch the Story

For each talk title, think on:

1. What are the takeaways you want audience members to leave the talk with?
2. For each of those takeaways, what are the pieces of information needed to get there?
3. What starting points (pre-requisite knowledge) do you want to assume?
4. How can you structure a journey from the starting points to the ending takeaways that introduces those pieces of information in a reasonable way?

That process is similar to the process teachers, documentation or textbook writers, and other knowledge sharers often take when structuring their content.
You're effectively performing a [tree traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal), where nodes are knowledge and lines are prerequisites.

## 5. Submit the CFP

Ok!
You've gotten your talk titles, abstracts, and general storylines figured out: time to submit the form.
As with job applications, I strongly recommend thoroughly filling out all pieces of information you can.
The biggest mistake I see in CFP submissions is teeny 1-2 sentence descriptions in fields like _Full Talk Description_.

That being said, don't put heaping mounds of unnecessary details.
Human beings with limited time will need to read your application and many others'.

You can see the Submissions table in my [Conferences Notion page](https://joshuakgoldberg.notion.site/Conferences-bfb4bb5065b44a8488ebd37271ff3bfc) for examples of what I've applied to conferences with.

### Aside: Speaker Bios

Most conferences ask for some kind of speaker biography / _"about you"_ field.
You don't have to think too hard on these.
List your name, your employment, technical areas you work with, and one or two fun facts.
I keep a copy & paste blurb in that Notion page for all conferences.

## 6. Don't Get My Hopes Up

Applying to conferences is like to applying for jobs: you're going to rejected loads of times, especially when you're new.
Many CFP processes are chaotic and poorly managed behind the scenes, which introduces a strong element of random chance to which submissions of yours will get chosen.
Then, even if a CFP process is well-managed, your submission just might not match what the organizers are looking for.

Getting rejected is part of the process.
That's totally fine!
Just keep applying, and eventually others will go in.

## FAQs

### Can you still go to a conference that rejected your CFP submission?

Absolutely!
Many conferences will give discounts as thanks for submitting.

### Do you need to go to conferences to be a good developer?

Absolutely not.
Many developers don't.

Conferences can be great for learning and networking, but they're not for everyone.
If you don't want to spend a day in a conference center with a bunch of strangers, that's completely reasonable.

### Do you need to be active on Twitter to speak at conferences?

No, but it's very helpful.
There are a lot of developer communities and discussions on Twitter and many conference organizers are active there.
I've made countless invaluable personal connections and tech discoveries by using Twitter daily.
I'd certainly recommend sticking at Twitter if you're up for it.

That being said, social media comes with a cost.
It takes time to actively work on engaging with others, responding to tweets, checking your timeline, etc.
And seeing the constant cycle of extreme takes, angry negativity, and general human stupidity that is the internet can be emotionally draining.
Some experienced speakers choose not to be active on social media, or even to not have accounts at all.

Do what's right for you.

### Do you need to be an expert on a subject to give a talk on it?

No.
_No!_

If only the top experts on subjects gave talks on those subjects, most conferences wouldn't be able to find speakers!

The only familiarity level you need for a subject is what your talk will cover plus a few common questions you expect people will ask.

For example, you don't need to deeply understand a UI library's rendering internals or the backing of its architectural decisions when giving a talk on getting started with it.
But do know FAQs such as how it works with data fetching, CSS-in-JS, and other important integrations.

### How do you know whether to submit to a conference?

If you're unsure, just submit.
You never know what the conference organizers will want to branch out to.

Nobody will be irritated or offended by your submission (as long as you do the due diligence mentioned in this post).

Remember: not all talks have to be technical.
I've seen fantastic talks at frontend conferences from junior and not-frontend developers on topics such as mentorship and teamwork.

If you're still unsure, you can always ask the conference organizers.
Or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg); I'm happy to encourage you!

### How can I find out about conferences?

I subscribe to as many newsletters, Twitter accounts, and automated services as possible.
That includes:

-   [Calling All Papers](https://callingallpapers.com)
-   [CFPLand](https://www.cfpland.com)
-   [SeeCFP](https://seecfp.com)
-   [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io)
-   [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com)

If you use Twitter, you might consider making a [Twitter List](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists) containing conferences you think you might be a speaker fit for.
Mine is [Josh Conference Matches](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1461079394861027328).

> Got another service to add to the list?
> Please [@ me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)!

### I don't think I know enough about anything to give a talk. How do I find a topic?

_Wrong._
You absolutely do know enough to give a talk on something.
See [Do you need to be an expert on a subject to give a talk on it?](#do-you-need-to-be-an-expert-on-a-subject-to-give-a-talk-on-it)

If you're really struggling to think of things, I'd suggest keeping a journal at work of the main lessons you learn.
I _guarantee_ you'll have at least a half dozen items within a month.

### I have anxiety. Can I speak at conferences?

Hey, me too!
Anxiety pals!

Plenty of conference speakers have anxiety and/or plenty of other variations of being human.
I can't answer that question for you specifically though.
We're all different.

By the way, I recommend everybody get a therapist if they can.
Even if you don't think you need it.
Even if you think your body and mind are already perfect (which, frankly, is a sign on its own that you probably need therapy...).
A good therapist can be shockingly helpful for many personal issues, including but not limited to fear of drawing attention to yourself, self-doubt, and social anxiety.

### I'm giving my first talk soon and I'm nervous. What do I do?

You got your first talk accepted!
Congrats, that's great!
Give yourself a pat on the back. 😊

Everybody gets nervous before their first talk.
It's a natural part of the process.

If you can, try giving the talk to people you trust, such as coworkers, family, and friends.
Rehearse it ahead of time as much as you think is helpful, then stop rehearsing it and go do something that takes your mind off it.
I especially recommend something mentally and/or physically engaging, such as exercise, a particularly engrossing book, going out with a close friend or three, or an old favorite video game.

Plan something fun for after the talk to treat yourself.

When you're getting ready to start the talk, breathe deeply and calmly.
You've done everything you can.
Everybody knows public speaking can be nerve-wracking.
Nobody whose opinion is worth anything will judge you harshly on your first talk.

**You got this!**

### Is it ok to repeat talk submissions?

I think so, unless the conference explicitly states they prefer not.
Giving a talk multiple times allows you to iterate on it and give a better talk each time.
Most developers don't go to very many conferences per year, so the chances that they'll see you give the same talk twice are very small.

Especially if you've got a talk you're excited about but haven't given yet, it's fine to submit it to multiple conferences.
Don't limit your chances of giving that great talk by only having one submission with it pending at a time.

### My proposal was accepted, but I have to back out for personal reasons. What do I do?

Talk to the organizers as soon as possible, and give them as much information as you feel comfortable sharing.
They will understand: personal situations happen, and it's not their place to try to force you to do their event.

(if anybody does, please let me know so I don't waste my time applying to their conferences!)

Messages like the following are inoffensive and reasonable:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I'm so sorry, something in my personal life came up and I can't speak at {conference} anymore.
>
> Thanks again for choosing me and giving me this opportunity.
> I hope we can make this happen another time.
>
> -{you}

If you have the energy and time, consider personalizing the message to how you've talked with the organizers in the past.

### My proposal was accepted, but I learned of something the conference does that makes me uncomfortable. What do I do?

Depends on the severity of the misdeed.
If it's something you'd feel comfortable talking to the organizers about, I strongly recommend reaching out to them directly to raise your misgivings.
Oftentimes the organizer will appreciate you talking to them and will work hard to make it right.

Messages like the following are inoffensive and reasonable:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I recently learned about {misdeed}.
> This is concerning to me because {reasons}.
>
> But, I want to hear your side of the story.
> Am I missing anything?
>
> Thanks!
> -{you}

If the bad deed is _really_ bad, though, it's absolutely fine to back out.
You don't want to help an event that violates your own moral code.

Messages like the following are inoffensive and reasonable:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I recently learned about {misdeed}.
> This is concerning to me because {reasons}.
>
> I don't feel comfortable speaking at a conference that {description}, and must back out.
>
> Best, {you}.

If you got accepted at this one event, you can get accepted at some other one later on.
Don't feel obligated to stay with a bad group.

### Should I make a speaker rider?

I have a [speaker rider](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/speaker-rider), which is a declaration of the things I need in order to speak at an event.
That speaker rider consists only of must-haves that I think every event should do:

-   Accessibility: Be it, whether in-person and/or online
-   Accommodations: Pay for travel expenses and my ticket
-   Code of Conduct: Have a real one
-   Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Be at least ~30% not-white-cisgender-male speakers

You don't need to have a speaker rider yourself.
I imagine my being a little more restrictive than many may hurt my chances for some conferences.

But, if you become a somewhat known name in your industry (which I am in TypeScript-land), I'd urge you to consider having one.
The more speakers require points such as accessibility, the more pressure conferences will feel to do the right thing.

## What are the best conference talks you've seen?

I've seen so many amazing ones!
"Best" is too subjective of a term.
This answer would be different each different month I try to answer it.

A couple great ones that have been top-of-mind for me recently are:

-   [Goodbye, UseEffect 👋: David Khourshid, React Brussels 2022](https://youtu.be/HPoC-k7Rxwo): An approachable, engaging explanation of the context, pitfalls, and common alternatives around React's `useEffect` API. Plus a great state charts product demo at the end!
    -   Note: I saw this in React Brussels, and will replace the link with that video once it's shared on YouTube!
-   [How We Automated our Relationship: Daphne Liu & Tiger Oakes, CascadiaJS 2022](https://youtu.be/Zxe7bDZweoI?t=70): Each project shown was cool on its own, but the speakers made it all exciting and added a lot of great humor and personal flair.
-   [A SERIOUS discussion about Next.js: Cassidy Williams, Reactathon 2021](https://youtu.be/dK2bTdb_CTc): A great walk-through of setting up a fun project in Next.js and deploying to Netlify, which I know many beginner developers found useful. Plus it breaks down the unapproachability of big frameworks in a hilarious way.

## What are your favorite talks you've given?

My favorite is giving wacky things, ideally also dive into cool technical stuff.
This is again subjective and might change each time you ask.
I do prefer in-person talks for the audience energy and more engaging physical presence.

1. [Binary Arithmetic in the TypeScript Type System: TSConf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lyb22x9tcM): my first in-person conference talk (!), about my favorite programming language (!!), about a wacky use case of its type system (!!!)
1. [From Takedown to TypeScript: A Retro Game Engine Story: CascadiaJS 2021](https://youtu.be/UhUFW-sYJwk): a personal story about my first big web project, how to sustainably grow projects, and barriers to entry _(sorry about the sound quality!)_
1. WebXR Karaoke: React Brussels 2022 (video pending!): A talk I've been working on for a while, which combines live karaoke, a 3d multiplayer demo, and enthusing about the future of code
