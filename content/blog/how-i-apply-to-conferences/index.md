title: "How I Apply to Conferences"
---

As of November 2022, I've applied to about 100 unique conferences and gotten accepted to about a third of them.
I've also started helping out organizing conferences, such as reviewing talks submitted by speakers.
So while I'm not the greatest conference speaker in the world, I think I've gotten at least good at them.

This blog post goes over the process that I take to submit my talks to CFPs (Call For Proposals).
That process can be summarized as:

1. [Pre-Work](#1-pre-work)
1. [Research the conference](#2-research-the-conference)
1. [Determine topic matches](#3-determine-topic-matches)
1. [Sketch the story](#4-sketch-the-story)
1. [Submit the CFP](#5-submit-the-cfp)
1. [Don't get my hopes up](#6-dont-get-my-hopes-up)

I've added a [Further Resources](#further-resources) section below, and a separate [FAQs article](../how-i-apply-to-conferences-faqs) for assorted questions.

I keep a publicly viewable [Conferences Notion page](https://joshuakgoldberg.notion.site/Conferences-bfb4bb5065b44a8488ebd37271ff3bfc) tracking what I've applied to conferences with.
Feel free to reference that as a resource of examples for what I mean throughout this post. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## 1. Pre-Work

Speaking at a conference is rarely the first bit of community involvement speakers take.
Start with smaller events so you can build your skills and network with other people in your areas of programming.

The strategy I took was:

1.  Start attending meetups, such as city-specific ones
1.  Speak at a meetup
1.  Actively ask meetup organizers for feedback on your talks there
1.  Repeat the previous two steps a few times
1.  Start attending conferences

Attending meetups and conferences is helpful for seeing what does or doesn't work in talks.
What kinds of topics do you relate to as an attendee?
What speaking styles, narrative arcs, and general storytelling methods make you excited about the topic and/or effectively transmit information to you?
Keep track of these things and remember them for when you want to submit your talks.

## 2. Research the conference

So you've found a conference you want to speak at.
Great!
Familiarize yourself with what the conference is about and what kinds of talks they tend to include:

-   Thoroughly read their website
-   Follow the conference and any organizers you can find on any social media you use
-   Watch talks from the most recent 1-2 iterations of the event

You wouldn't believe how many talk submissions CFPs get that are clearly low quality copy & paste, only barely suitable -if at all- for the conference's intended subject matter. üôÉ

## 3. Determine Topic Matches

Now that you have a feel for what the conference is looking for, try to recall your areas of work that match.
You don't need to present some amazing cutting-edge novel idea: just information you think attendees might want to know about.

A few examples of topic match areas I've seen come up frequently are:

-   General software engineering:
    -   Coding patterns you've found useful
    -   Documentation and/or new developer onboarding strategies
    -   How you approach testing
    -   Getting started using a popular framework
-   Frontend:
    -   Best practices with your chosen UI library (Angular components, React hooks, ...)
    -   Design systems
    -   How your team does microfrontends
    -   Using TypeScript
-   React:
    -   CSS-in-JS libraries (Emotion, Tailwind, Vanilla Extract, ...)
    -   Integrations with other libraries (Apollo, Redux, tRPC, ...)
    -   Your latest üå∂ hot take on hooks

It's impossible to know what topics will match well with organizers.
Since most conferences allow multiple CFP submissions, I generally try with a few different topics, often 2-3 out of:

1. A talk directly on the conference's focus
1. A talk generally on the conference's focus, but with a twist and/or another area
1. A talk partially on the conference's focus, but more on another topic and/or a fun twist

### Aside: Naming Talks

I find naming talks to be one of the hardest parts of CFPs.
A good talk title needs to be clear, concise, and to the point.
It's also often beneficial to include some flashy tech buzzwords to draw people in.

Keep your talk title as small as possible while still conveying the gist of your talk.
If you're getting stuck, try to combine 1-2 _buzzwords_ with a relatable **situation**.
Here are a few made-up examples:

-   _React Hooks_ **Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**
-   **Statically Catching Bugs** with _ESLint_ and _TypeScript_
-   How _TypeScript_ **Helps Scale Team Expertise**

Try checking past talks given at conferences you're applying to for more inspiration.

## 4. Sketch the Story

For each talk title, think on:

1. What are the takeaways you want audience members to leave the talk with?
2. For each of those takeaways, what are the pieces of information needed to get there?
3. What starting points (pre-requisite knowledge) do you want to assume?
4. How can you structure a journey from the starting points to the ending takeaways that introduces those pieces of information in a reasonable way?

That process is similar to the process teachers, documentation or textbook writers, and other knowledge sharers often take when structuring their content.

### Describing the Story

I often use a format like the following for descriptions:

1. State the context behind your talk
2. Summarize what your talk will cover
3. Give a list of topics within the talk
4. Summarize the conclusions/takeaways from the talk

These submissions of mine contain good examples of matching descriptions: [How to Complain Positively](https://www.notion.so/joshuakgoldberg/LeadDev-London-2023-2e51b443e42f46719448831973e00ab9) and [TypeScript Static Analysis Hidden Gems](https://www.notion.so/joshuakgoldberg/All-Things-Open-3157bc256629486d8a668632e547c6ba).

> I highly recommend reading _[On Writing Well](https://www.google.com/books/edition/On_Writing_Well/UvlnAAAAMAAJ?hl=en)_ to learn how to write engaging, pithy descriptions.
> Its lessons apply both to writing CFPs and giving the talks themselves.

## 5. Submit the CFP

Ok!
You've gotten your talk titles, abstracts, and general storylines figured out: time to submit the form.
As with job applications, I strongly recommend thoroughly filling out all pieces of information you can.
The biggest mistake I see in CFP submissions is teeny 1-2 sentence descriptions in fields like _Full Talk Description_.

That being said, don't put heaping mounds of unnecessary details.
Human beings with limited time will need to read your application and many others'.

### Aside: Speaker Bios

Most conferences ask for some kind of speaker biography / _"about you"_ field.
You don't have to think too hard on these.
List your name, your employment, technical areas you work with, and one or two fun facts.
I keep a copy & paste blurb in that Notion page for all conferences.

## 6. Don't Get My Hopes Up

Applying to conferences is like to applying for jobs: you're going to rejected loads of times, especially when you're new.
Many CFP processes are chaotic and poorly managed behind the scenes, which introduces a strong element of random chance to which submissions of yours will get chosen.
Then, even if a CFP process is well-managed, your submission just might not match what the organizers are looking for.

I was rejected from multiple conferences before I landed my first talk.
After that my rate was around 5% for a while.
Now it's around 35% or so.

Getting rejected is part of the process.
Keep applying and eventually you'll get in.
