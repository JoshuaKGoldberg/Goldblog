<em style="display:block;margin-bottom:2rem;text-align:center;">
My favorite meme symbolizing the difference between perceived and actual intelligence.
<br />
</em>

I've observed experienced and novice people across industries alike utter the following two phrases a lot (and have said them myself):

-   _"According to people much smarter than me..."_
-   _"This is a dumb question, but..."_

I think they get repeated for a few very admirable, logical reasons:

-   They're nervous about coming across as arrogant
-   They're nervous about the false impression that you need to be exceptionally smart to obtain important industry knowledge
-   They want to encourage less confident participants to ask questions

Caring about creating a friendly, welcoming community for newcomers is great.
But I've come to believe that these "false modesty" phrases are often actively harmful to community building.

## We're All Smart

> According to people much smarter than me...

Some folks suffer from a false perception that the experts in their field are unapproachable titans of industry who operate on an nigh unattainable intellectual level.
Describing differences between people in terms of intellectual superiority reinforces that perception.
While many experts are shockingly smart, many are not -- and it can be demotivating to think that you need to be a genius to be an expert.

Worse, if you're being perceived as an expert yourself, folks suffering imposter syndrome might already think there's an intelligence gap between you and them.
Phrasing other experts as much smarter than you can make it seem to that there are _multiple_ impossible-to-bridge intelligence gaps.

It's fine and good to give credit and recognition where they're due.
Calling out individuals as being very smart, saying you respect them greatly, and many other compliments are totally fine.
Just don't dig an unnecessary trench between newbies and experts.

## No Dumb Questions

> This is a dumb question, but...

When you describe a question you're asking as dumb, you risk alienating others who had the same question.
Sure, you're admitting that you might not be a genius expert -- but what about everybody else who had the same question?
You just said their question is dumb.
Not nice.

## Handy Replacements

The motivations behind those two phrases around approachability are great.
I don't want to discourage anybody from taking action on those motivations.
Instead of perpetuating the harmful perception that experts' intelligence is unattainable for most, though, try to use phrases that convey your intent more directly.

| Before                                        | After                                       |     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| According to people much smarter than me, ... | As phrased by people I greatly respect, ... |     |
| This is a dumb question, but...               | Apologies if I missed this, but...          |     |

Smart people are everywhere.
Everybody has a unique blend of knowledge and skill.
When you're new to an industry, seeing the knowledge and past successes of others you don't have (yet) can make you feel like you'll never get them and don't belong.
