title: "Respect the Free Tier"
---

Many product teams view their free\* product as a way to lead users into paying for the better version.
This is reasonable from a financial standpoint: if nobody pays for a product, its company goes out of business.
So, those teams invest much more in the paid product and overburden the free tier with ads for the paid tier.

But!
A free product tier is still an essential part of your user acquisition funnel.
Deprioritizing it is a risky move, and in the long term, often a mistake.

**Your free tier is the core product experience for a majority of your users.**
The worse you make it -and the more you overburden it with advertisements- the less those users will respect your product.
The less users respect the product, the less likely they are to recommend it to other users or stay long enough to convert to paid.

<small>\*For simplicity's sake, let's ignore ads and microtransactions, and assume products all have one "free" and one "paid" tier.</small>

## Recognizing a Deprioritized Free Product

Has this ever happened to you?

-   Frequent flash sales, often with high percentage discounts
-   Interstitial modals advertising the paid tier throughout the free experience
-   Mandatory trials of the paid tier that automatically start on account creation
-   UI elements that look like they launch features but instead launch more modals

If your product suffers from at least two of those _(and I do mean **suffers**)_, then you're not treating your free tier like a real product.
You're treating it like an over-engineered advertisement.
Give it some respect!

### The Problem with Flash Sales

### The Problem with Interstitial Modals

### The Problem with Mandatory Trials

A friend tells you about a nifty new free\* service.
You sign up, spend a few minutes touring the product, learn what what it is, and set some time aside in a couple of weeks to really use it.
Two weeks later, you open the app a second time - and are hit with this:

> Thanks for trying out the 14 day free trial!
> To continue using our features, please enter your credit card information.
>
> <em><small>(or click this teeny tiny button to continue as free)</small></em>

Why would they tease you with the paid version even though you never used it?
Rude.

Just because a user signs up for your product doesn't mean they're ready to power-use it.

### The Problem with Surprise Modals

## Aside: Easier Implementation

We should caveat all these complaints with a note that they're all quick solutions.
Oftentimes they're much easier to implement than a more fully thought-out, integrated solution.

Most companies are both understaffed and in a hurry to roll out new features.
They'll have to prioritize whatever wins they can get the fastest.
And the faster you release small changes, the faster you can learn from them and iterate.

Furthermore, account management and payments are important, complex parts of any serious application.
They can be quite difficult to apply changes to without breaking difficult-to-test edge cases.
And from a product perspective, removing pro tier upsells -no matter how intrusive they are- is hard to advocate for.

If you only recently launched your tier system, there's no shame in starting off with a simple implementation.
But if it lasts for many months you should start asking some serious questions.

## What To Do Instead of Deprioritizing Your Free Product

## Closing Thoughts

I'm not a product marketer, user experience designer, or any other not-software-programmer role that studies these product flows more intently.
