title: "Six Months of Full Time Open Source"
---

Open source software -software whose source code is freely available to anybody who wants it- has been a passion of mine for years.
That's why I quit my job at the end of January 2022 and started working full time on open source software in March of 2022 -- six months ago last week!
It's been an exhilarating journey so far, and I'm happy to say I'm going to keep doing it for the forseeable future!

The bright side of open source is that I've gotten to work on projects that I find technically interesting and/or push the state of modern web development forward.
The dark side of open source, though, is that **we as an industry have not figured out how to make open source financially sustainable for the vast majority of maintainers**.

## What I've Done

I've gotten a chance to work with some amazing people on fascinating projects.
Here's a quick summary of the most notable open source work I'm proud of:

-   Numerous bugfixes, documentation improvements, and features in TypeScript ESLint
    -   I'm particularly happy with the work I did on [automating rule docs](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/5593)
-   Numerous bugfixes, documentation improvements, and features in TypeStat
-   [Adding a Method Expression mutator to Stryker](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js/pull/3508)
-   Took over maintenance of [eslint-plugin-expect-type](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-expect-type) and fixed a few bugs
-   A [couple bugfixes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3AJoshuaKGoldberg+is%3Amerged+created%3A2022-02-28..2023-01-01) in TypeScript itself
-   Released [learningtypescript.com](https://learningtypescript.com) with dozens of free articles and projects for TypeScript
-   Released [chooseyouframework.dev](https://chooseyourframework.dev), which involved a whole suite of refactors and improvements to EightBittr
-   Released the [Refined Saved Replies](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/refined-saved-replies) Chrome extension

I also resumed [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joshuakgoldberg) and started uploading streams to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ag6LufUK30vkwS9lWHA8Q).

[Here's a GitHub issue search for all merged pull requests I've sent March onward in 2022](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AJoshuaKGoldberg+is%3Amerged+created%3A2022-02-28..2023-01-01+is%3Apublic).

## Funding Is Hard

Right now, having done all that work in public, I net about $600/month in open source sponsorships:

-   $200/month on [my own GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/JoshuaKGoldberg)
-   $400/month for my portion of [TypeScript ESLint sponsorships](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint)

For reference, $600/month of a full time job is roughly half the federal minimum wage ($7.25 per hour, or ~$1,200/month).
My base salary as a Staff Frontend Developer in 2021 earned me more money each work day than a month of my open source salary now.

### Side Gigs, at a Cost

I've brought my income up to tolerable levels by private company consulting, releasing the [_Learning TypeScript_ book](https://learningtypescript.com), and reviewing occasional pull requests on [pullrequest.com](https://pullrequest.com).
But, those side gigs take my time and energy away from open source work.
It's a mild vicious cycle: I don't earn a sustainable amount as an open source maintainer, so I have to work on side gigs, which takes time away from my open source work, which makes it harder for me to promote myself and land sponsorships.

Fortunately, I expect the sponsorships to grow as I make more of a name for myself and my projects.
My goal is to reach $1000/month by the end of the 2022.

## What's Coming Next

If you thought the above list was fun, just wait until you see what's coming up in the next six months.
My goals for Spring 2023 are:

-   Collaboratively get TypeScript ESLint to a new [6.x major version](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/milestone/8)
-   Learn the internals of TypeScript ESLint so I can meaningfully work on its at-scale performance issues
-   Bring TypeStat up to the point where it's stable and working on common React projects
-   Standardize tooling across my smaller repos -[emojisplosion](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emojisplosion), [konamomijisplosion](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/konamimojisplosion), [console-fail-test](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/console-fail-test), [eslint-plugin-expect-type](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-expect-type), ...- and tackle their immediately useful bugfixes and features
-   Continue adding to [learningtypescript.com/articles](https://www.learningtypescript.com/articles) for the most frequently asked TypeScript questions

...and who knows what else?!
One of the magical parts of open source web development is how ever-changing the landscape is.
I look forward to learning what innovations will be state-of-the-art even months from now.

## How You Can Support Me

All those great goals don't come cheap.
I'd greatly appreciate any support you can give me to make full time open source work sustainable.

-   ðŸ‘‰ [github.com/sponsors/JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/sponsors/JoshuaKGoldberg) ðŸ‘ˆ: the most direct way to help get more open source work done is with a monthly sponsorship on GitHub Sponsors.
    -   If want one direct way to support me, this is the best one!
-   [opencollective.com/typescript-eslint](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint): if you want to support the general [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io) maintenance team, that would be great too.
-   [learningtypescript.com](https://learningtypescript.com) contains links to buy my _Learning TypeScript_ book. A five star review is surprisingly helpful in promoting it, too.
-   [twitch.tv/JoshuaKGoldberg](https://twitch.tv/JoshuaKGoldberg) and [twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg): following/liking/subscribing helps increase my reach.

If you or your coworkers write TypeScript code, it might just be in your best interest to sponsor me so I can improve your developer experience.
Please let me know over [email](mailto:blog@joshuakgoldberg.com "my email") or [@JoshuaKGoldberg on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg) if there are any projects in particular that you're interested in.

Thanks for reading - and happy open sourcing, everyone! ðŸ’–
